PURPOSE
-------

This tool is an open source disassembler for the TM3260, a very long instruction word (VLIW) core.
The core is found in a range of broadband access equipment from 2Wire, as well as storage devices
from Buffalo, and other networked equipment.

Compiled with gcc 4.6.1 x86_64 Linux, and cross-compiled for Windows with mingw32-2 gcc version 4.2.1-sjlj.

USAGE
-----

see tm32dis --help

ISSUES
======

The TM3260 has a variable length instruction set.  It also has no word alignment for instructions,
nor for operations (aka "syllables").  This means that an instruction can begin at any memory location.

Since this disassembler can take any arbitrary offset to start disassembling, the TriMedia's lack
of code alignment means that the tool will attempt to disassemble data in non-text segments.

This is flagged by a warning "ILLEGAL OP!".   Human intervention is required to backtrace to establish
a 'hitching point' for a tract of code.    The official toolchain typically aligns text segments on 64
byte boundaries, so this is a good place to re-fix the start point when continuing a disassembly.

Many aspects of the TriMedia architecture, including the instruction compression scheme, are not
officially documented, and there are errors in the official literature. For example, some operations
are listed with clashing opcodes. It's likely that errors have crept into the disassembler because of
this.
